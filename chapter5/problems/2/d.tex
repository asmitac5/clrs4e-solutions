This situation can be viewed as an example of the coupon collector's problem (see Section 5.4.2), where the coupons we are trying to collect are represented by the indices of array $A$, and obtaining a coupon is represented by picking an index in line \ref{li:random-search-pick-index} of \proc{Random-Search}.
According to the solution to the problem presented in the book, in order to pick each of $n$ different indices, we should expect to check approximately $n\ln n$ randomly chosen indices.
