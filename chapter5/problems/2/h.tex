Suppose that we use procedure \proc{Randomly-Permute} (see Section 5.3) to permute the input array, performing $n$ exchanges of array elements.
The running time of \proc{Scramble-Search} is then proportional to the sum of $n$ and the number of comparisons performed by deterministic linear search.
These numbers for different values of $k$ were determined in parts (e), (f) and (g).
