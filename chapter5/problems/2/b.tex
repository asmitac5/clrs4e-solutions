Let $X$ be the random variable denoting the number of picked indices into $A$ before $x$ is found.
The search for $x$ performed by the procedure \proc{Random-Search} is a sequence of Bernoulli trials, where a success (the condition in line \ref{li:random-search-found}) occurs with probability $p=1/n$.
Applying equation (C.36), we get that the expected number of picked indices is $\E{X}=1/p=n$.
