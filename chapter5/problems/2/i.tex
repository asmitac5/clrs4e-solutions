When there are $k\ge1$ copies of the searched element in the input array the running times of all three algorithms are of the same order.
However, if the input array does not contain the searched element (i.e., when $k=0$), the running times of \proc{Deterministic-Search} and \proc{Scramble-Search} are asymptotically smaller than the running time of \proc{Random-Search}.
Moreover, \proc{Deterministic-Search} does not introduce the overhead of permuting the array, thus running faster by a constant factor than \proc{Scramble-Search}.
Therefore, \proc{Deterministic-Search} seems to be most practical one to use.
