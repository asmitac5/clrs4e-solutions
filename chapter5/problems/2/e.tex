\proc{Deterministic-Search} is identical to the linear search algorithm we studied in \refExercise{2.1-4}.
The case when there is only one copy of $x$ in the array of length $n$ was considered in \refExercise{2.2-3}, where it was found that the algorithm will check $(n+1)/2$ indices in the average case, and all $n$ indices in the worst case.
