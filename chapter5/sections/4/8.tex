\clarification{We assume that $n>16$, because only then the expression $\lg n-2\lg\lg n$ is positive.
Moreover, to simplify the calculations we do not care if numbers are not integers.}

Let $A_{ik}$ be the event that a streak of heads of length $k$ begins with the $i$th coin flip.
Then,
\begin{align*}
    1-\Pr{A_{i,\,\lg n-2\lg\lg n}} &= 1-\frac{1}{2^{\lg n-2\lg\lg n}} && \text{(by equation (5.9))} \\[1mm]
    &= 1-\frac{2^{2\lg\lg n}}{2^{\lg n}} \\[1mm]
    &= 1-\frac{\lg^2n}{n}
\end{align*}
is the probability that the $\lg n-2\lg\lg n$ consecutive coin flips beginning with the $i$th flip do not yield only heads.

Let us partition a sequence of $n$ flips into $n/(\lg n-2\lg\lg n)$ groups of $\lg n-2\lg\lg n$ consecutive flips each.
Each of these groups is composed of distinct and mutually independent flips, so the probability that none of the groups is a streak of heads of length $\lg n-2\lg\lg n$ is at most
\begin{align*}
    \left(1-\frac{\lg^2n}{n}\right)^{n/(\lg n-2\lg\lg n)} &\le \left(e^{-(\lg^2n)/n}\right)^{n/(\lg n-2\lg\lg n)} && \text{(by inequality (3.14))} \\
    &= e^{-(\lg^2n)/(\lg n-2\lg\lg n)} \\
    &< e^{-(\lg^2n)/\lg n} && \text{(since $n>16$)} \\
    &= e^{-\lg n} \\
    &= 1/n.
\end{align*}
Therefore, a streak of length $\lg n-2\lg\lg n$ of consecutive heads occurs with the probability of at least $1-1/n$.
