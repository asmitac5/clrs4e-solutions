In the analysis of the birthday paradox, the independence of birthdays is used only on page 140 to justify the formula
\[
    \Pr{b_i=r\;\text{and}\;b_j=r} = \Pr{b_i=r}\Pr{b_j=r}.
\]
It is therefore sufficient to assume that birthdays are pairwise independent.
This is because we are interested in finding pairs of people with same birthdays, not groups of arbitrary size of such people.
