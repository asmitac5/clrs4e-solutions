This algorithm does not work as intended.
If $n>1$, it generates permutations in which each position contains an element different from the one that initially occupied that position.
For instance, for the input array $A=\langle1,2,3\rangle$, the algorithm is capable of producing one of two permutations: $\langle2,1,3\rangle$ and $\langle3,1,2\rangle$.
