The proof is by contradiction.
Suppose that in a Monge array $A$ there exists $1\le i<m$ such that $f(i)>f(i+1)$.
By the definition of $f$,
\[
    A[i,f(i+1)] > A[i,f(i)]
\]
and
\[
    A[i+1,f(i)] \ge A[i+1,f(i+1)],
\]
and thus
\[
    A[i,f(i+1)]+A[i+1,f(i)] > A[i,f(i)]+A[i+1,f(i+1)].
\]
However, the above inequality contradicts the condition from the Monge array definition, for $j=f(i+1)$, $k=i+1$, and $l=f(i)$.
