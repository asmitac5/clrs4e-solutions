Let $G$ be the set of all good chips and let $B$ be the set of all bad chips.
Good chips report that any chip in $G$ is good, and that any chip in $B$ is bad.
On the other hand, bad chips can follow the strategy to mirror the good chips behavior\dash they can consistently report that any chip in $B$ is good, and that any chip in $G$ is bad.
This means that relying on pairwise tests only\dash with no additional assumptions\dash the professor wouldn't be able to distinguish $G$ from $B$.
