Changing a parameter-passing strategy can only affect the driving function in the recurrence that describes the running time of a recursive algorithm.
For each algorithm that we discuss in this problem, we've studied their running times when arrays passed by pointer, so we'll match $T_{a1}(N,n)$, $T_{b1}(N,n)$, $T_{c1}(N,n)$ and the recurrences we've seen in those analyses.
