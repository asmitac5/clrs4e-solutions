The worst-case running time of merge sort is described by recurrence (2.3), so we have
\[
    T_{b1}(N,n) = 2T_{b1}(N,n/2)+\Theta(n),
\]
and the solution is $T_{b1}(N,n)=\Theta(n\lg n)$.

Passing arrays by copying adds the term $\Theta(N)$ to the driving function of the previous recurrence:
\[
    T_{b2}(N,n) = 2T_{b2}(N,n/2)+\Theta(n)+\Theta(N).
\]
Note that the term $\Theta(N)$ only adds a constant per each level of recursion, and since the recursion has $\Theta(\lg n)$ levels, the term introduces $\Theta(N\lg n)$ in total.
Hence,
\begin{align*}
    T_{b2}(N,n) &= T_{b1}(N,n)+\Theta(N\lg n) \\
    &= \Theta(n\lg n)+\Theta(N\lg n) \\
    &= \Theta((n+N)\lg n).
\end{align*}

The recurrence for the worst-case running time of merge sort when passing only the relevant fragment of an array is
\[
    T_{b3}(N,n) = 2T_{b3}(N,n/2)+\Theta(n),
\]
which is identical to $T_{b1}(N,n)$, and thus $T_{b3}(N,n)=\Theta(n\lg n)$.
