Since $\bigl|\widehat\phi\bigr|<1$, it holds that $\bigl|\widehat\phi^i\bigr|<1$ for $i>0$, and $\bigl|\widehat\phi^i\bigr|/\!\sqrt{5}<1/\!\sqrt{5}<1/2$.
Then,
\begin{align*}
    F_i &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}(\phi^i-\widehat\phi^i) && \text{(by part (c))} \\
    &= \frac{\phi^i}{\sqrt{5}}-\frac{\widehat\phi^i}{\sqrt{5}},
\end{align*}
from where
\[
	\frac{\phi^i}{\sqrt{5}}-\frac{1}{2} < F_i < \frac{\phi^i}{\sqrt{5}}+\frac{1}{2}.
\]
Those bounds on $F_i$ differ exactly by 1, so there is a unique integer between them, close to $\phi^i/\sqrt{5}$.
By the above inequalities, that integer has to be $F_i$.
