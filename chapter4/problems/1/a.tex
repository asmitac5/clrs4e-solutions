We have $a=2$ and $b=2$, which means that $n^{\log_ba}=n^{\log_22}=n$, and $f(n)=n^3=\Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon\le2$.
Also, it holds that $2f(n/2)=2n^3\!/8\le cf(n)$ for any $c\ge1/4$, satisfying the regularity condition.
By case~3, the solution to the recurrence is $T(n)=\Theta(n^3)$.
