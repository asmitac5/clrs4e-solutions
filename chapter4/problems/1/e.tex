We have $a=8$ and $b=3$, which means that $n^{\log_ba}=n^{\log_38}=O(n^{1.9})$, and $f(n)=n^2=\Omega(n^{\log_ba+\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon$ can be as large as approximately $0.1$.
Also, it holds that $8f(n/3)=8n^2\!/9\le cf(n)$ for any $c\ge8/9$, satisfying the regularity condition.
By case~3, the solution to the recurrence is $T(n)=\Theta(n^2)$.
