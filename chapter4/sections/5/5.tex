As long as $b>1$, $0<a<b$, and $\epsilon>0$ is sufficiently small, it holds that
\begin{align*}
    f(n) &\ge 2^{\lg n} \\
    &= n \\
    &= \Omega(n^{\log_ba+\epsilon}).
\end{align*}
Furthermore,
\begin{align*}
    af(n/b) &= a2^{\lceil\lg(n/b)\rceil} \\
    &< a2^{\lg n-\lg b+1} && \text{(by inequality (3.2))} \\
    &= (2a/b)2^{\lg n} \\
    &\le (2a/b)f(n),
\end{align*}
so the regularity condition isn't satisfied for all sufficiently large $n$, if $2a/b\ge1$.

Therefore, by choosing any constants $a$, $b$ and $\epsilon$, such that $1/2<b/2\le a<b$ and $0<\epsilon\le1-\log_ba$, we satisfy all the conditions in case~3, except the regularity condition.
