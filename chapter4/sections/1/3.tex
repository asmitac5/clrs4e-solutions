At each recursive step the time spent on partitioning the matrices and copying the results is $\Theta(n^2)$, so the recurrence (4.9) changes to
\[
    T(n) = 8T(n/2)+\Theta(n^2).
\]
To show it has the same solution as the original recurrence, let's use the master method from Section 4.5.
The above is a master recurrence with $a=8$, $b=2$, and driving function $f(n)=\Theta(n^2)$.
Since $n^{\log_ba}=n^{\lg8}=n^3$ and $f(n)=O(n^{3-\epsilon})$ for any $0<\epsilon\le1$, we can apply case~1 of the master theorem to get $T(n)=\Theta(n^3)$.
