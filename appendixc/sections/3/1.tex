The expected sum of the two values showing on two 6-sided dice has already been calculated in \refExercise{5.2-4} and equals 7.

Define the random variable $Y$ to be the maximum of the values showing.
For each $y=1$, 2, \dots, 6, the value $y$ is the maximum of the values on both dice, when one die has value $y$, and the other die has value at most $y$.
This happens for exactly $2y-1$ outcomes.
Thus,
\begin{align*}
    \E{Y} &= \sum_{y=1}^6y\Pr{Y=y} \\
    &= (1/36)\cdot(1\cdot1+2\cdot3+3\cdot5+4\cdot7+5\cdot9+6\cdot11) \\
    &= 161/36 \\
    &\approx 4.47.
\end{align*}
